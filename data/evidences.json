The evidence appears as a ghostly silhouette or hologram in the light of the projector when a ghost passes through it.\n- The figure seen does not indicate where the ghost is headed, it is just a visual effect.\n- You can see this figure through a [video camera](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Camera). \n- If you have a Goryo, the effect will only appear through a [video camera](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Camera) while nobody is in the room."

The “airball” from a ghost event will move towards a player."
