    "about": "[Spirit Box evidence](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Box_(Evidence)) can be obtained by using a [Spirit Box](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Box) and getting a response from the ghost when asking a question from [this list](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Spirit_Box#Types_of_questions) of questions.\n- The player must either be in the same room as the ghost, or within 3 meters of it.\n- All ambient lighting in the said room must be off.\n- Some ghosts only respond to people who are alone.\n- When all conditions are satisfied, the ghost becomes more likely to respond. This likelihood increases with the tier of the Spirit Box."

A reading of 32Â°F or below is required.\n- Temperatures will adjust over time, and therefore multiple rooms can be freezing and a freezing room does not guarantee a ghost is in that room.\n- The thermometer fluctuates by -2 / +4 degrees.\n- Any ghost type's presence in a room will cause the room's [temperature](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Temperature) to drop over time."

They appear after a ghost interacts with certain surfaces, mostly being doors and light switches.\n- Each interaction with a surface will always leave a fingerprint.\n- The exception is the [Obake](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Obake), who has a chance to leave fingerprints (75%), which can also be unique (~17%).\n- Fingerprints must be \"charged\" with [UV Light](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/UV_Light) before collecting [photo rewards](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Photo_Rewards).\n- Footprints, although visually similar, do not count."

The evidence appears as a ghostly silhouette or hologram in the light of the projector when a ghost passes through it.\n- You can see this figure through a [video camera](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Camera). With a video camera in night vision mode, visibility of the figure may be much better. \n- If you have a Goryo, the effect will only appear through a [video camera](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Camera) while nobody is in the room."
